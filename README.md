Flask on Docker

Overview
This repository demonstrates how to containerize a Flask application using Docker. The project leverages PostgreSQL as its database, Gunicorn as a production-grade WSGI server, and Nginx as a reverse proxy. Inspired by TestDriven.ioâ€™s guide on Dockerizing Flask with Postgres, Gunicorn, and Nginx, this repo includes separate configurations for development and production environments, making it easy to build and deploy the app in any setting.
